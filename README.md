# aqua-py
A Python interface for astrocyte quantification and analysis

For details of AQuA for Matlab, see https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA

## Installation

```
pip install aqua-astrocytes
```

## Todo

* `aqua.stats` currently has features mostly-implemented that are super cool (e.g., inhomogeneous rate function estimation and statistical comparison, kernel regression estimation and statistical comparison) but are not fully documented.
* It would be nice to pull the MATLAB conversion scripts in here somehow.
